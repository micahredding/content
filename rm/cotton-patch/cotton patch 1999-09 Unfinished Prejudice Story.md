The South has been known for its racial prejudice since before Civil War days. The black race was used to provide slaves for the big plantations of the South and the economy of the southern farmers depended on that fact. The Emancipation Proclamation did not rid the southerners of their prejudice, nor did it truly free the slaves. Prejudice prevented the education of the black people and slavery kept them in poverty so that they had no money with which to buy homes and lands when they were freed. 

There were some good masters who did well by their freed slaves. Many of them allowed the blacks to stay on and “**sharecrop**”, by which they worked the land and gave the owner a percentage of the crops as payment for use of the land. The success of this arrangement depended to a large degree on the attitude of the landowner, but it also depended on the ability of the sharecropper. Those who learned management skills by having observed their masters had a better chance than the browbeaten slaves whose spirits had not soared above their destitute circumstances. These failures gave the white man all the reason he needed to continue in his prejudicial mindset.

Some of the freed slaves went north believing that they would receive better treatment there and that they would find good paying jobs. Here, again, the lack of education and the lack of experience in anything except hard manual labor caused a delay in their advancement. Prejudice began to grow in the North as well as the South, and we have seen it continue to some degree to the present time.

It is most sad in all of this, however, when we realize that prejudice was so well ingrained in the thoughts and ideas of people that whether God-fearing, or not, people could not rid themselves of its grip. Even churches and religious educational institutions refused equal rights to the black people. Theatres and restaurants had their back doors and rooms. Buses had their backseats and there were separate toilet facilities for the “coloreds” and “whites”. “White” schools, churches and colleges, including our Christian colleges, were not open to the black race as late as the 1940’s!

When we have known people who were honestly trying to serve God, yet staunchly held to their prejudicial convictions, we are made aware of how effective early and thorough training can be. It doesn’t matter whether the things taught are based or truth or error, are logical or illogical, it is difficult to break away from their hold.
