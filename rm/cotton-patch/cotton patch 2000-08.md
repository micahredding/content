If my father had lived until January first of this year, he would have welcomed in the new millenium 2000 A.D with a passion. Having been born August 1, 1900, he could have seen, except for a few months, the entire twentieth century. That would have been exciting!

If Dad were here today, he would delight in telling everyone what tremendous changes had occurred in his lifetime. Concerning the first quarter of the century, he would recall how horses, horse-drawn carriages and trains slowly gave way to automobiles, so that by the late twenties, many families owned their own cars.

Change begets change. Rough, muddy streets were not as easily traveled on in the newfangled vehicles as they had been with horses, and poor pedestrians and onlookers were subjected to more dust or mud being stirred up and slung at them by fast rotating wheels. Streets needed to be changed to harder smoother surfaces and sidewalks became a necessity for the comfort and safety of shoppers walking about town. As more and more families began to travel together, women’s clothing had to slim down to allow room for everyone to fit into their vehicle and so ruffles, bustles and hoop skirts gave way to slimmer styles of the “flapper” era.

Dramatic changes resulted from everyone having their own automobile, but during the second quarter when electricity became available to rural Americans, the door was wide open to a variety of new experiences. Electric lights, stoves, refrigerators, washing machines, sewing machines and radios became standard items in a household. Following that came record players, tape recorders, typewriters, etc., and in the late forties TV antennae began to adorn the roof tops of city homes.

Of all the electrical gadgets that developed during those years, TV has been the most controversial and yet it has influenced our lifestyles considerably. From active, creative, outdoor recreation to sedate, passive indoor entertainment. Indoor, interactive family fun with games such as Monopoly, Tiddlywinks, Checkers, Bingo, Old Maid, Dominoes, jigsaw puzzles, charades, plays and skits (made up on the spot), singing, story telling and readings have been laid aside while the TV does the entertaining of its passive living room audiences who interact very little among themselves.

My parents had a TV, and I know they enjoyed being in touch with what was happening in the news and weather. Although I had moved away by then, I can imagine them enjoying the Lawrence Welk show and Red Skelton. Mom would have loved historical novels and Dad would have kept up with political issues. He was a true patriot of our country and always said he enjoyed paying taxes! He knew that without them his schools would suffer from lack of funds, and he realized how much we all enjoy good roads and public facilities that make life easier. He certainly made good use of the government-owned TVA lakes in northern Alabama where fishing became one of his greatest passions.

Dad was very interested in science, history, geography and math, and as I make this statement, I recall that he held a high regard for the disciplines of English and literature as well. Perhaps being the dedicated teacher that he was, he developed an interest in all areas that could provide him with knowledge that he considered important to the many students he hoped to influence.

Since his death in the early seventies, the standards for TV shows has changed tremendously. Dad would lament over the fact that immorality is displayed so unashamedly; in fact he would be very vocal about it. He would be saddened to tears at the perversion of love as it is portrayed in the lyrics of popular songs and in movies. So much of what he tried to teach in schools and churches would be lost in the flood of publicity that seems to laud the greed, lust and selfishness of human beings without a God. His patriotic emotions for his country would have been crushed by the immoral acts of our president and by the fact that his behavior got a mere “slap on the wrist.”

Except for mainframes and punch cards, computers were unheard of when Dad died. Had he lived to see PC’s in every school and home, he would see them as tools of education and be delighted at the opportunities they could provide. Upon further investigation, he would become dismayed by the availability of smut and pornography via e-mail and chat rooms as well as entire web sites. He would be torn in his judgement: “Does the good outweigh the bad?” He would not deny the use of computers or TV or anything that has such a great potential for education, but he would increase his efforts to teach right from wrong. He would impress on individuals the importance of maintaining their own integrity whether anyone else around them did so or not.

I believe this represents how Dad would have perceived a century of changes if he could have spoken to us on August 1, 2000 A.D.
