The prejudice that presented its ugly head in the lives of Southern people was not unique to those who were reprobates. As a learned tradition, it etched its way into the hearts of Christians who should have known better. The fact that there were conflicts in what some people verbalized with what they did gives me a little comfort as I recall some interactions of family members with black acquaintances.

My Dad made remarks occasionally that were not becoming to his position as an educator and certainly not to his profession as a Christian minister. Even though I never voiced my disappointment, I can remember having thoughts that something was wrong. On the other hand, I can recall times when Dad showed kindness to people who needed help regardless of who they were.

In the forties and fifties, there was a black minister of the gospel of Christ who was held in high esteem among many people, and even though he has been dead for several years, his praises can still be heard from time to time. A school to train preachers continues to operate in the Dallas, Texas area as a result of Brother Marshall Keeble. As a young girl, I remember that Dad took the family to a neighboring town to hear Brother Keeble in a tent meeting. He was known for using a lot of humor to get across his important messages of salvation. My brother who sat on the first row of seats in the tent declared that he saw a rainbow in the moisture that sprayed from Brother Keeble’s mouth as he laughed during one of his witty sayings that evening.

Years later, my husband and I were privileged to take our small family to an outdoor meeting in Abilene, Texas in which some of Brother Keeble’s preacher students made talks. I felt it a great privilege to have experienced those two occasions, and I am pleased that as an educator, I discovered and read two wonderful books to my students. One book, _Amos Fortune, Free Man_, was about a slave man who was given his freedom early in life and he spent the rest of his life buying the freedom of others. The other book was a biography of George Washington Carver of whom I never cease to be amazed at his numerous talents. From musician to botanist, to chemist, to artist, to sports doctor, to educator, Mr. Carver credited all of his abilities to God.

Most people identify prejudice with racial problems, but it has and does still exist in many other areas. During World War II when Hitler began pouring out his terrible wrath upon Jews and others, people in the US identified all Germans with the detestable dictator and Nazism. This kind of generalization is common in which we attribute one person’s characteristics to all who belong to the same group.

If my dad’s sister had not married a German and established a family well in advance of the war, I may have fallen into the same trap that many people of that era did. Uncle Carl was a very decent man whose father owned a meat market in Athens, Alabama. Carl worked with his dad and eventually took over the business himself. He and my aunt had three boys and one daughter and I never thought of them as being anything but Americans until people began to talk about Germans. I found myself arguing against the idea that all Germans were bad! If I had not known and loved this family, I may have succumbed to the same poor logic that many others did at that time.

My aunt was an educator as were many of my father’s and mother’s family members. She taught math in high school and Uncle Carl had his business in town, so they were not identified with farm life. I don’t remember that any of their children worked in Grandad’s or Uncle Buddy’s fields as I did, but I felt accepted by them and my security of belonging was strenghtened in my relationship with them.

Prejudice can exist between races, between sexes, between rich and poor, between young and old, between educated and uneducated, and it can extend in both directions. The cotton patch had the potential to equalize all who worked in it side by side, but it did not always succeed.

Prejudice can rob us of potentially rewarding relationships. Making generalizations is a form of prejudice totally unfair to those in the group who have done nothing wrong. We should be willing to give honor to whom honor is due regardless of social status, race, creed, etc.
