I don't know the exact ordering of these. There's a confusion in the first group between what they're labeled, and what the documents say themselves.

Then, after the first 12, I'm not sure the order. 

- There's a 3-part winter collection. 
- There's a "Volume 2" collection, which probably comes after the first 12, but I'm not sure. I'm also not sure what order they should be in. One of them is a Christmas article, which might have been published—but I don't know. 
- There's a 98 bluebird document, which I think should be two parts. 
- There's a set in 99, leading up to an unfinished one, which has several versions. My guess is that none of those were published.

Reconstructing these documents was a bit tricky, because they were converted from Microsoft Publisher documents. Some of the articles had to be reordered, and I had to do that based on my best guess. Some of the articles were mixed up with other articles. 

I’ve tried to reconstruct them as accurately as possible, including bold and italic (I might have missed some on the first two), and preserving spelling and punctuation as closely as possible.
