The cotton patch was was not only a workplace, it was a virtual schoolroom in which one could learn about plants, animals, birds, insects and types of soil. One could learn about soil erosion, the effects of too much or too little rain on the growth of plants and how that would affect crop production. Changes in the position of Earth with respect to the sun was observed in the shadows. We learned to watch as our shadows grew shorter and shorter. When we could stand on our heads, we knew it was lunchtime! We also watched when our shadows got long, letting us know that quitting time was near.

The various shapes and colors of the clouds triggered our imaginations, and as we watched the illusive figures of animals and men, we could see indications of changes in the weather. The movements of the clouds were as true in telling wind direction as the wind vanes that often adorned barns and farm houses, and the dark undersides of the otherwise white fluffy cumulus clouds hinted of rain.

When the clouds moved into position between us and the sun, we welcomed the short relief from the direct heat of the sun’s rays, and we learned to anticipate those times as we watched shadows scurrying across the ground toward us.

The cotton patch was a place of socializing with people of different backgrounds in education, in religion, in moral upbringing and from different economic levels, although there were none there from among the rich and famous. It is most likely that Eli Whitney picked some cotton in his day, and George Washington Carver would, undoubtedly, have picked cotton if he hadn’t been working in sweet potatoes and peanuts.

Our parents were teachers and Dad was a preacher, facts that brought us into frequent contact with those who had better houses, clothes and cars than we. This had both its pros and cons. We had a sense of well being for what we stood for, and that helped to overcome the knowledge that we did not possess as much in material goods as the owners of the cotton patches, even though they were our relatives. Working side by side with cousins whose parents owned the farms was a way of making us equal, and we enjoyed our kinship by sharing our innermost feelings and thoughts.

Some workers were unrelated to us, and by them we were presented different views of living than we had known in our own sheltered family circles. We sometimes got into “friendly” arguments about religious or moral issues in which there were no declared winners. We *each* knew that *we *had won. It was not an education that changed one’s beliefs, but it was an education about people, about tolerance and about acceptance. The cotton patch was an equalizer, a common bond that generated respect one for the other.

As I look back over my learning experiences during those days, I am thankful that I did not learn some of the things that many young people learned. Because of the honesty of the people I worked for, I did not learn that it was all right to cheat people out of their day’s wages. All workers received equal pay for equal work.

I did not learn to cheat cotton ginners by making the load of cotton weigh more. There were no hidden weights and there was no wet cotton underneath the white fluffy cotton. It just wasn’t done.

There was no yelling, no unkind words and no cussing that ever reached my ears. I am truly grateful to be able to say that I did not learn harsh nor vile speaking as I worked among the farmers and their farm hands.

I did not learn immoral behavior while working in the fields. There were no indecent acts, gestures, or suggestions that I was ever aware of, and I prefer to believe that they simply did not occur, even behind my back.

I am thankful and proud to have had such a solid foundation on which to build my life. Before I leave the impression that everything and everybody was perfect, however, I must mention a major weakness that kept rearing its ugly head even among the best of that heritage.

The mindset of the South with respect to the black race had its beginnings before the Civil War, and prejudice was so well taught from generation to generation that it did not go away with Abraham Lincoln’s signing of the proclamation that slaves were free. So subtle was its influence and so disguised was its ugliness, that it was almost universally accepted, even among the God-fearing people as well as the unscrupulous! What impact this had on me...next time.

Knowing that early training and teaching can have such a strong influence in the lives of our children, we must make sure that those things that we teach are good and true and approved of God.

*Next time: the forbidden idol*
