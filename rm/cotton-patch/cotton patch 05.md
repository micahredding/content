When I was between three and seven years old, my dad was the principal of a school that contained all grades from the first through the twelfth. It was a rural community, but there was little, if any, cotton grown in the neighborhood. Everyone did grow most of their own food, however, and they had to work very hard from the breaking of the land in the spring until the canning or storing of the produce in the fall was completed. School teachers were paid rather meager salaries for nine or ten months of the year, so my parents had to be part-time farmers in order to feed family.

I was so young at this point that I did not work in the fields or garden very much, but I was able to help gather in sweet potatoes with their milk-like juice oozing from the ones that suffered a cut from the plow or hoe. Walking barefoot in the soft plowed earth was a spiritual experience to my young being, and my sticky stained hands didn’t make it any less so. I also helped with drying fruit that we could eat or use in deserts when the season for fresh fruit was gone. We prepared peaches and apples for drying by first removing the inedible parts and then cutting the good juicy fruit into slices. Big cloths or bed sheets were laid out on top of a tin-roofed shed, and on these we spread out the fruit and let the sun do the rest. When the rays from the sun hit the tin roof and heated the fruit from beneath as well as from above, it did not take long to have sweet, dried fruit.

We usually owned a cow in order to have milk and butter; we tended pigs to provide meat such as bacon and ham; we raised chickens to supply us with eggs (however, some of the chickens ended up as **real country-fried chicken** or baked or stewed hen); we also kept a horse or two for plowing the garden and fields.

I did not start milking a cow until I was older, but I had my turn at the churn. It was a real challenge to make the butter come as quickly as possible. When whole sweet milk is kept at room temperature, it sours and then it **clabbers,** or becomes gelatinous. When one puts this clabber into a churn and pushes and pulls a dasher up and down through it, the fat and pulls the dasher up and down through it, the cream eventually rises to the top and becomes butter. The remaining liquid is known as buttermilk (which when accompanied with hot, moist cornbread, we considered a real treat). While churning, we used to sing a rhyme to pass the time away and to keep the hand on the dasher moving quickly up and down, up and down. “Come, butter, come.....Come, butter, come......” (Does anyone out there remember the rest of it?)

Mother was a very hard worker, and she did not shirk the menial, dirty and difficult jobs as they were presented to her for helping her family survive. I recall once when Dad slaughtered a hog, Mother worked hard and long in preparing the meat, and she was literally so sick that she could not eat any of it for a time. While I cannot rely on my memory to be infallible, it seems that she used every possible part of that hog including the head and the feet. I do remember that she made **souse,** which was also know as “hog’s head cheese” because of the part of the hog that was used to make it. That is called survival!

During this time (mid 30’s) we did our heating and cooking with wood-burning stoves. We had no refrigerators, electric lights, running water or indoor bathrooms. We kept some perishable foods in an insulated box, known as an **icebox,** into which big blocks of ice were placed to provide the low temperature. Ice was delivered on a long flatbed truck by a little cigar-smoking gentleman named Sam Mitchell. Blocks of ice came in weights of 25 or 50 pounds....I now wonder how much those blocks weighed by the time they were carried into the houses with the big **ice tongs** and put into the iceboxes!

Coming next..... modern lights, radios and washing machines!

This is the fifth part in a series written by a grandmother about her life as she grew up in the days when most farmers plowed with horses, cotton was weeded and thinned with garden hoes, and mature cotton was picked by hand. Family members and hired hands worked together side by side... a common cause making all persons equally important.
