When the weather didn’t permit us to play outside in our *houses *constructed from the great variety of natural products, we simply went indoors and created our “homesteads” with different resources.

The equipment we used for playing “house” indoors was very inexpensive. There were no Barbies and Kens with their dream houses and cars and million dollar wardrobes. We capitalized on a process, which today is called *recycling. *With a few empty oatmeal boxes and shoe boxes, a pair of scissors, and some outdated catalogs from Sears, JC Penney, or Montgomery Ward, we created socio-economic levels of existence that far surpassed the reality of our lives.

You can guess what we did with the catalogs. We cut out Mothers and Fathers, brothers, sisters, babies and all manner of relatives and neighbors. We very carefully chose characters for ourselves that exhibited whatever we wanted to become in our world of make-believe. In our playing, we each directed any number of the characters by moving them from place to place and being their voices as they filled their particular roles. There was no prepared script. We were experts at adlibbing! But, wait. I’m getting ahead of myself. We need *houses *and *furniture* before we can play “house.”

We took the boxes and created three dimensional furniture. Our “people” could lie on flat paper beds cut from the catalogs, but it was much more realistic to have chairs and couches on which we could bend our dolls at their knees and waists so they could sit as they talked and ate together. Small shoeboxes could become tables or beds depending on what one needed and without any special cutting or shaping. Round oatmeal boxes made excellent cradles when the two ends were removed, the cylinder cut in half lengthwise and then the ends replaced on one of the halves to give it stability and to form a headboard and a footboard.

There was a lot of fancy furniture in the catalogs, but the efforts that we put forth to fold and cut paper into shapes that became neat little pieces of furniture fulfilled the creativity within us.

We never talked about lines of symmetry in a piece of furniture, but we seemed to instinctively know how to fold paper so that we could make the fewest cuts and magically make similar parts the same size without use of rulers. Our fun might have quickly disappeared had someone told us how much mathematics was involved in what we were doing. On the other hand, if we had been taught mathematics through such activities, the study of math might have held a much greater appeal to many students.

The art of creating paper furniture was evidently learned by imitating experienced people. I tried to put into words how to fold and make a simple chair, but it made such a very boring script, I decided to let you discover and create your own methods. . Involve some children. Make it fun!

While on the subject of recreation, I want to include some memories of Easter.

We attended the gatherings of our Christian brothers and sisters each Sunday, therefore attending church was no different on Easter than on any other Sunday. New outfits were not necessities among the farm people of Alabama in those days, so there was not a big interest in seeing who at church would be dressed in the finest clothes. So what could make Easter special?

Spending the afternoon at my paternal grandparents’ with all my aunts, uncles and cousins was a happy experience. We had lots of colored hard boiled eggs, some small jelly beans and some big cream candy eggs. We took turns hiding and finding the same eggs over and over, taking time out ever so often to eat a few.

The cool green grass, the yellow daffodils, narcissus and buttercups, the grape colored hyacinths, the little blue daisies and the violets brought a freshness to our world that had been somewhat dull during the winter months. Even though the earth was quite cool, we delighted in slipping off our shoes and running barefoot in the soft grass. What could be more perfect?

I thank God for the faith that prevailed in the lives of my extended family so that such gatherings were calm and peaceful, giving us children a wonderful feeling of security and a joy in belonging.

Recreation is worthless unless one is recreated in mind, body and spirit as a result of it. Creativity can help one achieve those results. A peaceful atmosphere surrounding one’s activities can also help one achieve recreation that is beneficial to well-being.
