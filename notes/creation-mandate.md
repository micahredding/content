The Creation Mandate is a description of the human calling as described in Genesis 1.

1. In Genesis 1:26-28, humanity is said to created to *be like God*, to *be God's image*, and to *rule all things*.
2. In context, Genesis depicts God creating and cultivating life, through processes such as naming and organizing creation.
3. We thus understand that ruling all things *like God does* looks like the creation and cultivation of life.
4. We thus understand that ruling all things *like God does* looks like naming and organizing creation. Further, we see that God leads humanity in doing exactly these things in Genesis 2, and in the rest of scripture.
5. We thus understand that science and technology (naming and organizing creation) for the good of humanity and of all life, is intrinsic to human identity and calling.
