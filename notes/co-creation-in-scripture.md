# Co-Creation with God in scripture

This is my basic framework for understanding this idea:

1. Genesis 1 gives us the [Creation Mandate](creation-mandate.md), the calling to *rule all things* in imitation of God. This calling is exemplified for us in God's own activity of creating and cultivating life, and the processes of naming and ordering creation. Genesis 2 depicts God leading early humanity in these processes, the embryonic versions of science and technology.
2. We do not believe God is absent, and so we understand our rule, our creativity, our ordering of creation to be *with God* in some sense, not a supplanting of God. For us to do as God has called us is not a replacement of God, but the actualization of God's command, and to the fulfillment of God's glory. 
3. The New Testament reveals just how deeply *with God* God intends for us to be.
  * The Spirit of God is to dwell in us (Acts 2:38, Ephesians 1:14),
  * and we in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17, Romans 8:1, John 15:4, Galatians 3:27),
  * and Christ in us (Colossians 1:27, Romans 8:9, Galatians 1:15-16, Galatians 2:20, Galatians 4:6, Galatians 4:19, Ephesians 3:17, 2 Corinthians 4:6-7),
  * and we with Christ in God (John 17:21-23).
4. Thus, we understand that *it is God who works in us* (Philippians 2:12-13), that God has planned good works for us to do (Ephesians 2:10), and that these are even greater than the works Jesus did in his earthly ministry (John 14:12-14).
5. Thus, we do not draw back from scripture's depictions of us reigning with God, sitting on God's throne (Revelation 3:21), ruling over all things (1 Corinthians 6:2-3). It is fitting for us to occupy these places and roles, because we occupy them in and with Christ, and Christ is in God.
6. Thus, we understand that God calls us into partnership and participation, such that we have something real and unique to contribute, and yet our contributions are simultaneously God's contributions, and yet are no less ours.
