# Here be Dragons

“Here be dragons” was not superstitious babble, but a deep acknowledgement of unknown dangers, forces and factors beyond human control. It was the Athenian's “altar to an unknown god”, it was the system containing a pointer to that which it could not contain.

All of our systems must do this, must allow for that which we cannot know and cannot predict, must map that which is inherently unmappable. Only then can we last more than moments, only then can we have the potential to grow and scale and encompass new things, adjusting to bold new dangers as we go.
