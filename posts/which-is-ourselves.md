# Rejection

Sometimes we must reject that within us which is not ourselves.

And sometimes we must reject that within us which *is* ourselves, only we don't know it yet. Later we will return and reclaim it, something valuable snatched back from the fire, something which has been tested and proved valuable because it has survived the flames of our own self-immolation.
